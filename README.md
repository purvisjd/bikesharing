# CityBike Program Viability Evaluation and Report

## Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was the evaluation of bike sharing usage data obtained from CitiBikeNYC.  The data was representative of usage data for New York City for the month of August in 2019.  A series of charts and graphs were developed within Tableau Public to provide an asthetical demonstration of key points of information for the usage of said program in New York City.  This information was then taken and applied towards a more generalized evaluation to determine the viability and potential success of a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa.
